# Flags and claims

Append-only log. Sessions record here: node claims (to avoid duplicate work),
failed attempts (node id, model, what was tried, where it broke), and
statement concerns (never fix a statement yourself — flag it).

Format, one entry per line block:

```
## <date> <node-id> <model> <status: claimed | failed | statement-concern | done>
<free text: what was tried / where it broke / concern>
```

## 2026-07-07 N2.1 Haiku done
Implemented `rho` as a definition counting solutions to n(n+2) ≡ 0 (mod d).
Used pattern matching on d to handle d=0 case, and Finset.filter for d>0.
Clean build, axioms: [propext, Classical.choice, Quot.sound].

## 2026-07-07 N2.5 Haiku done
Implemented `twinProd_strictMono` lemma proving n ↦ n*(n+2) is strictly monotone.
Used calc chain with Nat arithmetic lemmas. 
Clean build, axioms: [propext, Quot.sound].

## 2026-07-07 N4.1 Haiku failed
Attempted to prove 6^ω(d) ≤ d³ for squarefree d. Requires product-of-factors
bound via unique factorization (showing ∏(p | d) p = d) and Finset manipulation.
This is class-B/C (requires squarefree API + finset product algebra), not class-A.
Blocked on tier. Escalate to Sonnet/Opus.

## 2026-07-07 N4.1 Sonnet done
Proved `six_pow_omega_le_d_cubed` using `Nat.prod_primeFactors_of_squarefree`
(d = ∏ p ∈ primeFactors, p for squarefree d), then `Finset.prod_le_prod` termwise
(6 ≤ p³ for prime p ≥ 2, via nlinarith) and `Finset.prod_pow` to fold back to d³.
Clean build, axioms: [propext, Classical.choice, Quot.sound].

## 2026-07-07 N2.3 Sonnet done
Proved `rho_two : rho 2 = 1` and `rho_odd_prime : p.Prime → p ≠ 2 → rho p = 2`.
Refactored `rho`'s definition (N2.1) from a `d+1` pattern-match to an
`if h : d = 0 then 0 else haveI : NeZero d := ⟨h⟩; ...` form — the pattern-match
version made `Fintype (ZMod d)` instances for general `d` fail to unify
definitionally when rewriting `p = (p-1)+1` (motive-not-type-correct errors),
since equal-but-syntactically-different `NeZero` proofs produced non-defeq
`Fintype` instances. The `if`/`haveI` form sidesteps this. Key mathlib lemmas:
`ZMod.natCast_eq_zero_iff`, `Nat.prime_dvd_prime_iff_eq`, `Finset.card_insert_of_notMem`
(not `_not_mem`, renamed in this mathlib version). Also note: `decide` fails with
"Expected type must not contain free variables" on ZMod-2 equalities when a local
`Fact p.Prime` instance is in scope (routes DecidableEq through the Field
instance); works fine decided in isolation before introducing Fact.
Clean build, axioms: [propext, Classical.choice, Quot.sound].

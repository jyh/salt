# Flags and claims

Append-only log. Sessions record here: node claims (to avoid duplicate work),
failed attempts (node id, model, what was tried, where it broke), and
statement concerns (never fix a statement yourself — flag it).

Format, one entry per line block:

```
## <date> <node-id> <model> <status: claimed | failed | statement-concern | done>
<free text: what was tried / where it broke / concern>
```

## 2026-07-07 N2.1 Haiku done
Implemented `rho` as a definition counting solutions to n(n+2) ≡ 0 (mod d).
Used pattern matching on d to handle d=0 case, and Finset.filter for d>0.
Clean build, axioms: [propext, Classical.choice, Quot.sound].

## 2026-07-07 N2.5 Haiku done
Implemented `twinProd_strictMono` lemma proving n ↦ n*(n+2) is strictly monotone.
Used calc chain with Nat arithmetic lemmas. 
Clean build, axioms: [propext, Quot.sound].
